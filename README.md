You can now get concussions from fall damage

If you fall like 5 blocks you get a concussion. It gives you nausea and if you look at a bright light too long you get blindness and start taking damage. Oh, and the effect lasts for 3 irl days so have fun I guess, or just drink some milk. Also this was made in a single afternoon.
